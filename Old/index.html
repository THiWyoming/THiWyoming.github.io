<!--     <p class="info">Our product is a christmas ornament that you could hang on your christmas tree, stocking, or even wreath. The ornament is inspired by the Christmas reindeer, in all of its beauty. We plan to donate every cent to charity, specifically The World Central Kitchen. This product is planned to drop on December 7th, with the price being $3.50. The ornament is hand made, to insure that you get the best product possible. The ornament is made with mainly wood and wool. Our promise is that you are 100% satisfied with our product.</p> -->
	<p class="info">Our products are pallet-style coasters, using a tried and true design and high-quality materials. These coasters make great gifts, for loved ones or for yourself. We designed the air gap between the table and the glass to allow moisture to evaporate in case of a spill, preventing stains on the table. Our coasters are inspired by the sturdy and efficient wooden pallet, made to lift thousands of pounds. <br> All of our proceeds go to the #TeamSeas project to help eliminate ocean waste. Our coasters are handmade out of wood, to ensure the best quality possible. They cost $1.75 per coaster, but purchasing through bundles can reduce the cost to as low as $1.10 per coaster. <br> We hope you enjoy our pallet-coasters! <br> - The SCJ team.</p>
