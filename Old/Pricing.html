    <h1>Pricing and Pre-Orders</h1>

    <p class="info">The product is $1.75 per coaster if purchased without a bundle, most of the price comes from the actual price of the materials that are needed to make the pallets. The remaining profit goes directly towards our charity, which you can read more about on the charity page. The product is mainly wood, with a hint of hot glue and a few other materials that add the final touch to the pallet coaster, which gives it style and uniqueness. <br> We have made a promise to make sure that the coasters are the best they can be, by making the product as diligently, and carefully as possible. As well, we have also decided to make an online pre-order sheet for your convenience. <br> If you would like to pre-order, simply fill out the form below with the necessary information. We are only accepting cash at the moment and you can provide your child with the funds or purchase directly after school.
