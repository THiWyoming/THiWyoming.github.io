		<p>The charity we are supporting is <a href="https://teamseas.org/" target="_blank">#TEAMSEAS</a>. The Team Seas Project is run by Mr. Beast, a world famous philanthropist who aims to clean 30 million pounds of trash from our oceans, rivers and beaches. So far, they have cleaned up over 13 million pounds from the ocean, and our goal is to raise at least $50.00 for the TeamSeas project. <br> Every purchase contributes toward our goal, with a $1:1 pound of waste ratio. If we meet our goal, we will be able to remove 50 POUNDS of trash from our oceans. </p>
		<p>We choose this organization to help contribute towards the fight against global pollution. The ocean is a vital part of our world, covering more than 70% of the planet and absorbing more than 50% of greenhouse gasses. We need to keep our oceans clean so we can enjo the fresh air and clean food we have now. Remember, every purchase made removes up to 10 pounds of raw garbage from the Earth.</p>
